# Cloud Module - Exercise 2

In this repository, Github pages have been automatically implemented through Github Actions y and the gh-pages library. To do this, every time a push is made to master, a build and deployment flow is triggered.

This repository has two branches:

- Master: the repository code is hosted.
- Gh-pages: only the compiled of the project is hosted.
